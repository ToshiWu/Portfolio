not contain peanuts,/MY BOYFRIEND TRIED THE MEDITERRANEAN CHICKEN SALAD AND FELL IN LOVE,/their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place,/PRICING IS A BIT OF A CONCERN AT MELLOW MUSHROOM,/worst thai ever,/IF YOU STAY IN VEGAS YOU MUST GET BREAKFAST HERE AT LEAST ONCE,/i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service,/THE PIZZA SELECTIONS ARE GOOD,/i had strawberry tea, which was good,/HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE TO A LOYAL PATRON!/overall, a great experience,/SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE,/their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter,,, mmmm,,,!/THE BUFFET AT BELLAGIO WAS FAR FROM WHAT I ANTICIPATED,/and the drinks are weak, people!/-MY ORDER WAS NOT CORRECT,/also, i feel like the chips are bought, not made in house,/AFTER THE DISAPPOINTING DINNER WE WENT ELSEWHERE FOR DESSERT,/the chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!/WE WON'T BE RETURNING,/this is my new fav vegas buffet spot,/I SERIOUSLY CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE OWNER HAS SO MANY UNEXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES THAT ALL ARE RUNNING AROUND LIKE CHICKENS WITH THEIR HEADS CUT OFF,/very, very sad,/I FELT INSULTED AND DISRESPECTED, HOW COULD YOU TALK AND JUDGE ANOTHER HUMAN BEING LIKE THAT?/how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, i don't understand!/I'M NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE CONCEPT OR THE FOOD,/the only thing i wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as i don't like it puréed,/THERE IS REALLY NOTHING FOR ME AT POSTINOS, HOPE YOUR EXPERIENCE IS BETTER/i got food poisoning here at the buffet,/THEY BROUGHT A FRESH BATCH OF FRIES AND I WAS THINKING YAY SOMETHING WARM BUT NO!/what should have been a hilarious, yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us,/NEEDLESS TO SAY, I WON'T BE GOING BACK ANYTIME SOON,/this place is disgusting!/EVERY TIME I EAT HERE, I SEE CARING TEAMWORK TO A PROFESSIONAL DEGREE,/the ri style calamari was a joke,/HOWEVER, THERE WAS SO MUCH GARLIC IN THE FONDUE, IT WAS BARELY EDIBLE,/i could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch,/IT WAS SO BAD, I HAD LOST THE HEART TO FINISH IT,/it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it,/WE AREN'T ONES TO MAKE A SCENE AT RESTAURANTS BUT I JUST DON'T GET IT,,,DEFINITELY LOST THE LOVE AFTER THIS ONE!/disappointing experience,/THE FOOD IS ABOUT ON PAR WITH DENNY'S, WHICH IS TO SAY, NOT GOOD AT ALL,/if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you,/WAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY OVER RATED IS ALL I AM SAYING,/we won't be going back,/THE PLACE WAS FAIRLY CLEAN BUT THE FOOD SIMPLY WASN'T WORTH IT,/this place lacked style!!/THE SANGRIA WAS ABOUT HALF OF A GLASS WINE FULL AND WAS $12, RIDICULOUS,/don't bother coming here,/THE MEAT WAS PRETTY DRY, I HAD THE SLICED BRISKET AND PULLED PORK,/the building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but i wouldn't eat here again,/IT WAS EQUALLY AWFUL,/probably not in a hurry to go back,/VERY SLOW AT SEATING EVEN WITH RESERVATION,/not good by any stretch of the imagination,/THE CASHEW CREAM SAUCE WAS BLAND AND THE VEGETABLES WERE UNDERCOOKED,/the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat,/IT WAS A BIT TOO SWEET, NOT REALLY SPICY ENOUGH, AND LACKED FLAVOR,/i was very disappointed!!/THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE AND WAY OVERPRICED,/maybe it's just their vegetarian fare, but i've been twice and i thought it was average at best,/IT WASN'T BUSY AT ALL AND NOW WE KNOW WHY,/the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu,/THE AMBIANCE HERE DID NOT FEEL LIKE A BUFFET SETTING, BUT MORE OF A DOUCHEY INDOOR GARDEN FOR TEA AND BISCUITS,/con: spotty service,/THE FRIES WERE NOT HOT, AND NEITHER WAS MY BURGER,/but then they came back cold,/THEN OUR FOOD CAME OUT, DISAPPOINTMENT ENSUED,/the real disappointment was our waiter,/MY HUSBAND SAID SHE WAS VERY RUDE,,, DID NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE FOR THE BAD FOOD OR ANYTHING,/the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach,/INSULTS, PROFOUND DEUCHEBAGGERY, AND HAD TO GO OUTSIDE FOR A SMOKE BREAK WHILE SERVING JUST TO SOLIDIFY IT,/if someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?/SHE WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED ALTHOUGH SOME BLAME NEEDS TO BE PLACED AT HER DOOR,/after all the rave reviews i couldn't wait to eat here,,,,,,what a disappointment!/DEL TACO IS PRETTY NASTY AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED IF POSSIBLE,/it's not hard to make a decent hamburger,/BUT I DON'T LIKE IT,/hell no will i go back/WE'VE HAVE GOTTEN A MUCH BETTER SERVICE FROM THE PIZZA PLACE NEXT DOOR THAN THE SERVICES WE RECEIVED FROM THIS RESTAURANT,/i don't know what the big deal is about this place, but i won't be back \"ya'all\",/I IMMEDIATELY SAID I WANTED TO TALK TO THE MANAGER BUT I DID NOT WANT TO TALK TO THE GUY WHO WAS DOING SHOTS OF FIREBALL BEHIND THE BAR,/the ambiance isn't much better,/UNFORTUNATELY, IT ONLY SET US UP FOR DISAPPPOINTMENT WITH OUR ENTREES,/the food wasn't good,/YOUR SERVERS SUCK, WAIT, CORRECTION, OUR SERVER HEIMER SUCKED,/what happened next was pretty,,,,off putting,/TOO BAD CAUSE I KNOW IT'S FAMILY OWNED, I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS PLACE,/overpriced for what you are getting,/I VOMITED IN THE BATHROOM MID LUNCH,/i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food,/I HAVE BEEN TO VERY FEW PLACES TO EAT THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I EVER RETURN TO, AND THIS TOPS THE LIST,/we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh,/FOOD WAS BELOW AVERAGE,/it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant,/ALL IN ALL, HA LONG BAY WAS A BIT OF A FLOP,/the problem i have is that they charge $11,99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables),/SHRIMP- WHEN I UNWRAPPED IT (I LIVE ONLY 1/2 A MILE FROM BRUSHFIRE) IT WAS LITERALLY ICE COLD,/it lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry,/IT REALLY IS IMPRESSIVE THAT THE PLACE HASN'T CLOSED DOWN,/i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage,/THE REFRIED BEANS THAT CAME WITH MY MEAL WERE DRIED OUT AND CRUSTY AND THE FOOD WAS BLAND,/spend your money and time some place else,/A LADY AT THE TABLE NEXT TO US FOUND A LIVE GREEN CATERPILLAR IN HER SALAD,/the presentation of the food was awful,/I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW DISAPPOINTED I WAS,/i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking,/APPETITE INSTANTLY GONE,/overall i was not impressed and would not go back,/THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS UNDERWHELMING, AND I THINK WE'LL JUST GO TO NINJA SUSHI NEXT TIME,/then, as if i hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check,\n"
