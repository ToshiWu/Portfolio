Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it\\'s just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I\\'m sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40\\'s right.\\n\\nThere slogan was \" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN \" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It\\'s just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.\\n\\nThe only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.\\n\\nAt any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.\\n\\nNote :::; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container, I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass.')\n",
